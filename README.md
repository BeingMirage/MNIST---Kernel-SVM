# MNIST Digit Classification with Kernelized SVM

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project utilizes the `scikit-learn` library to build and evaluate the model.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images of handwritten digits using an SVM with an RBF kernel. The dataset used is the Digits dataset, which is a subset of the MNIST dataset containing 8x8 pixel grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9.

Key features:
- Loading and visualizing the Digits dataset
- Preprocessing the data
- Training an RBF kernelized SVM model
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing incorrect predictions

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Load the dataset**: The dataset is loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_digits`.

2. **Visualize a sample**: Use `plt.matshow` to visualize a sample image from the dataset.

3. **Preprocess the data**: Flatten the images and split the dataset into training and test sets.

4. **Train the model**: An SVM with an RBF kernel is trained on the training set.

5. **Evaluate the model**: Compute the accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix on the test set.

6. **Visualize incorrect predictions**: Display images where the model's predictions do not match the true labels.

To run the code, simply execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Results

After training and evaluating the model, you will get:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified images.
- **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing the true vs. predicted labels.

Incorrect predictions will be visualized in a grid, showing the true and predicted labels for a subset of misclassified images.
